# 🎸 Aurelio: Street Maestro

A CS50x final project made with Scratch.  
This is an interactive story about coins, music, choices... and a guy named Aurelio who just wants to eat (and maybe play you a song).

## 🕹️ How to Play

You start with **2 coins**.  
Click on the coins to decide how much you're willing to give to Aurelio, the street musician.

- 🪙 **Give 1 coin:** He’ll play a song for you.
- 🪙🪙 **Give both coins:** He’ll reward your generosity with something extra.
- ❌ **Give nothing:** Expect some sarcasm or even you can get insulted idk. Aurelio doesn’t forget.

No keyboard needed — just use your mouse and your moral compass.

Made entirely by **me**, as a personal challenge to stop procrastinating and finish what I start.  
Built for **CS50x** — Harvard’s Introduction to Computer Science.  
Made with Scratch and a lot of weird ideas.
